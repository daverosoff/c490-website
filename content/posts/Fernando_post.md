### **Going through the Linux experience!**
Being part of CSC-490 during Winter term 2022 was a gret challenge. Going deep through Linux was a new experience that allowed me to understand better how my own machine works in the terminal. At first, I learned commands that allowed me to move from derectory, create files and directories, check permissions, manipulate files, how to configurate `vimcr` and work in `vim`. Also, the first part of the section allowed me to understand better how filters work in a Linux enviroment. We worked in different assigments, but what I liked the most by using the Linux terminal was to run codes that allowed me to manipulate data in an easier way. 

The other side of the class was focused on Visual Studio (VS). I had some experience working on VS, but I never went deeper as we did during winter term. I learend new things such as snippets. An easier way to work on VS. Also, I got to use new extensions I never used before. Also, one of the things I really like the most during this winter semester was to connect github with VS. 

I never worked before on GitHub in the past, and I found this part of the term challenging since to set up the configurations to connect from my local machine to GitHub was quite difficult and confuse from the Linux terminal. But doing branchs, commits, push, pull, remote or clone from VS to GitHub was way easier to manipulate. Besides how challeging was git, I found this section of the semester really helpfull since I know this information will help me for future projects and specially jobs.

### **Applying my learning to a new context.**
Among all the information gained this winter term,this course provided me with new tools such as GitHub that are strongly used for many companies. Learning Linux and GitHub is helping me to build my portfolio that I will present to companies in future when I start applying for jobs. I think this is relevant becuase it will allow me to show my skills and effort put to build a strong portfolio.  

### **Curiosity and awareness about new ideas or techniques.**
While we worked with Linux, I learned a couple of codes such that `chmod` that allow the user, group, and others to `rwx` into a file or directory according to the access provided. I found this part interesting because this is a way to secure a file or directory from others. I want to say this is a very good technic for cybersecurity since it restrings the access to a file. In fact, if another user wants to read what it is in a private file where just my user is allowed to read and execute, they won’t be able to run it since I did not give them access to it. I think this is a very good technic to protect our information. Another topic that I really liked was talking about `KeyPass`. As programmer, I know my job is to use different passwords for every single account I register. This is important because in case of cyber-attacks, they won’t have access to all my accounts. However, during this course, I learned another way to save my passwords in a safer way and run them without the necessity to write them every single time. Also, this program builds strong passwords. I consider these two parts interesting and important to take care for possible cyber-attacks.   

### **Classroom experience contribution upon the rest of your education.**
Overall, this experience has helped me to work in a more professional manner. By my past experiences, I got the knowledge of problem-solving but I never published my work in any place. Now, we this information, I’m able to post on my account and use my works as part of my portfolio.
### **Exploring new parts of software development.**
This course made me curios to learn more about Linux in order to develop a better sense of cyber security. We learned a couple of codes during class that are actually useful to protect my information, and I think I can go deeper in this topic and learn more about cyber awareness and security. 
### **Aspects of the classroom experience that contributed most to my learning**
As I mentioned above, Linux and GitHub are the two experiences during class that contributed most to my learning. I got interested on these two topics specially because Linux can help me to manipulate my personal machine in a deeper and professional way, and GitHub allows me to build my portfolio that I will show for future jobs, research and internships.  
### **What new insights did you develop regarding your career plans as a result of this class?**
My purpose in future is to focus on CyberSecurity. One of the topics that is very commun to talk in cybersecurity is Linux. Thanks to this semester, I got to understand better some topics that I read in the past related with cyber security. This course motivated me to improve my skills in Linux so I can apply them in Cyber. 

### **How would you describe this class experience to a potential employer in a way that synthesizes knowledge and skills gained?**
I will say this is the type of class needed to develop a better understanding of tools that are commonly used in jobs. During this course, I got the opportunity to ask as many questions as I had and ask for help as many times I got into troubles at the extent I learned from my mistakes more than expected. To do that outside of a labor enviroment relieves me becuase I don't have the pressure to know how to work in GitHub or Linux already. Being able to have a sense of different tools such as Visual Studio, Linux terminal, and GitHub is a strong statement during jobs interviews. I found this course totally helpfull and I hope I can keep developing these areas in a deeper way in my other courses.
