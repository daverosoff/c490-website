# Going through the Linux experience!
####  Being part of CSC-490 during Winter term 2022 was a gret challenge. Going deep through Linux was a new experience that allowed me to understand better how my own machine works in the terminal. At first, I learned commands that allowed me to move from derectory, create files and directories, check permissions, manipulate files, how to configurate vimcr and work in vim.Also, the first part of the section allowed me to understand better how filters work in a Linux enviroment. We worked in different assigments, but what I liked the most by using the terminal for Linux, was to run codes that allowed me to  do things that most probably I will do remotely if I did not know the information. 

####  The other side of the class was focused on Visual Studio (VS). I had some experience working on VS, but I never went deeper as we did during winter term. I learend new things such as snippets. An easier way to work on VS. Also, I got to use new extensions I never used before. Also, one of the things I really like the most during this winter semester was to connect github with VS. 
####  I never worked before on GitHub in the past, and I found this part of the term challenging since to set up the configurations to connect from my local machine to GitHub was quite difficult and confuse from the Linux terminal. But doing commits and push it from VS to GitHub was way easier to manipulate. Besides how challeging was git, I found this section of the semester really helpfull since this information will help me for future projects and future jobs.
