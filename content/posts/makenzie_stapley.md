## My Background

I don't come from a CS background. This is only my second formal CS course. I'm studying Math-Physics, so I haven't used credit space to take more than the minimum CS required by my major thus far. However, coding is a big part of most sciences these days. Therefore, I had to learn Python and use it in the research setting. After working with Dr. Devine this summer, I discovered that I thouroughly enjoy coding. The puzzles and problem-solving that are inherent in computer science produce a similar level of excitement as solving a complicated math or physics problem. This, along with some personal struggles, has lead me to reevaluate my plans for post-graduation. I no longer plan to attend graduate school, at least not yet. I plan on continuing to expand my skillset in computer science, and engage in some self-exploration. Hopefully, I'll discover a career along the way!

## CSC-490 Hard Skills

The "hard skills" are what most people think of when you discuss what you took away from a course. These are the units and coding skills we spent time on: bash, Visual Studio Code, and git.

#### Bash

Before this course, I had no experience with bash. I wasn't completely intimidated by the command line becuase I had to use a PowerShell to install packages for Anaconda. However, everything else was new to me. I think I've come a long way. I now feel comfortable using the command line and vim to manage and create files. We wrote a few scripts in class, but the scripts we created as homework forced me to learn how to problem solve and debug in this "minimalist" setting. Learning how to ustilize man pages and other resources was extremely helpful. I feel like even if I don't know how to do something, I know how to figure it out.

The projects we accomplished in class and/or as homework were beneficial. We created scripts that I feel solve problems we'll come accross in the real world. It didn't ever feel like the assigment had the attitude of "do this thing, just because". I felt like I learned something valuable with every script. I learned how to use vim. I enjoy vim as an editor because it's simple yet powerful. I learned how to use coding strategies I utilize a lot in python in this setting.

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code was the section that made me the most excited. Before this course, I was solely using Anaconda (Syder and Jupyter Notebooks) to program. I'm not sure if I just don't know how to utilize that software properly, or if it just can't do what I wanted it to do. Either way, I was (and still am) very excited about VS Code. It is extremely customizable, so I can get it set up in a way that makes sense to me. I've started to learn keyboard shortcuts that allow my hands to write and execute code closer to the speed my mind works. With more time and practice, I think I can almost eliminate that disconnect.

We used VS Code in two facets in this course. First, we approached coding challenges in class to practice keyboard shortcuts and make us better at coding in general. I felt like this was a great use of class time. There's only so much you can learn from watching someone code, so the in-class practice was fun and valuable for learning. I know I'm far from being proficent in this tool. However, I do enjoy using it, so I will get there soon!

### Git

I had some experience with GitHub before this course. I learned how to use it to share the code I wrote this summer with others on the research team. However, I didn't know anything about git on my local machine. Version management is exciting to me. I can't tell you how many times I've completely broken code that works in an attempt to improve something. Now, I know how to just get back to the code that worked without having to manually go in and un-do all of my changes.

Then, there's the collaboration aspect of git when used in combination with GitHub. Most of my coding experience thus far has been individual and isolated. I'm excited about now having the tools to work on programs with another person (or multiple people!). I think working on some of the project ideas I have with collaborators will help prepare me for potential jobs in the industry as well as improve my coding skills through the collaboration.

## CSC-490 Soft Skills

I always like to note the soft skills I gained and/or improved when reflecting on anything. At times, these are the most important areas of growth. For example, since I don't have much experience working on code with other people, I came into this course not knowing how to talk about code. I didn't have necesary skills to ask or answer questions about these topics in a beneficial way. However, through in-class work time and working on homework with a peer, I learned these skills through practice.

I also learned how to collaborate as well. I worked with a peer on most assignments, and we have very different coding styles. This pushed us to work together to find ways to fix problems without driving each other crazy. I believe this will be a very useful skill if/when I find myself collaborating with coworkers in the future.

## Key Takeaways

Overall, this course was an extremely beneficial learning experience for me. I may not have mastered any of the topics we went over, but I did start the learning process for all of them. I hope to continue to play around with these things as I continue to build on my skillset and become a better coder. I enjoyed this class, and I think I learned a lot!
