# My Experience?

For this Winter term I learned about virtual machines, specifically Linux. I worked on VMware systems for most of the semester but had to switch towards the end of the semester to Ubuntu due to software issues. 
I learned the command line interface of Linux, both Bash and Zsh.  

Exploring Vi and Vim editors and learning Bash scripting was rewarding. Also, learning the different wildcards, filters, piping, and other syntax intrigued me to keep on learning. 

Then I moved on to learn Visual Studio Code and interact with the different aspects of it. Such as extensions, running my scripts and debugging them. And learning the keyboard shortcuts to be faster at typing code out.  

Finally, I learned the usefulness of Git and how it can be helpful for collaborations. I used to rely in group projects on a single document to edit. Although, I always felt awkward adding my part of the project in real time for everyone to see. It's much less stressful to edit a part a document in a separate space without other eyes watching. 

## Transfering my experience to a new context

Learning Linux has helped me see how much faster it is for storing and retrieving data compared to how I used to store and retrieve my data. Not only that but installing libraries to use for various Python projects is more convenient. Simply using the command line for most of my interactions with my computer is easier. Going forward I think I will substitute Excel for Linux. Getting extensions for VSC and combining it with Linux can replace many of the functionalities of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. 

### Curiosity on new ideas

Before starting this class, I was a little timid about getting my feet wet with using new software for programming. Now I do feel more confident in starting new software without being scared off by the vastness of content. 

For example, when my VMware software bit the bullet towards the end of this class, I had to install Ubuntu on my windows. Before this class I would have panicked installing it by myself and would have pushed it off to a later date. After completing this class however, and going through the basics and more advanced functions of Linux, I feel much more comfortable with handling different software's. 

#### Classroom experience transfering into my education

The experience I have gained in this class has boosted my education at the College of Idaho. Having additional technological skills helps with my business major. Having knowledge in Linux as well as bash scripting allows me to have an edge in Business. If I can pull and manipulate data to my choosing, then I can achieve faster results. Using Linux in Finance or Marketing would make research or calculations more effective. 

I can also take Git into various classes as well. Whenever I get into group projects, I will do my best to convince my group mates to give Git a chance. I also think this class has built up my logic skills compared to other programming classes. 

##### New parts of software development

I think learning Linux has made me more intrigued to study python libraires. It's convenient to install them in the terminal and use their properties, but before this class I would have never bothered with them. I want to learn more about python libraires as they are extremely useful for coding projects. Learning more advanced features on Linux and GitHub have also stroked my interests. 

###### Classroom experience contributing to learning

Doing in class exercises and projects during class time helped me learn the most. Another addition that aided me in learning was working in a group setting with someone smarter and more knowledgeable on the subject. I could go through each part of an exercise and if I got stuck, instead of looking up an answer, I could strategize with my group to help me solve my endevour. 

###### Instight on career path

New insights I gained regarding this class in relation to my career plans would be firstly knowledge of Linux based systems, Bash scripting, and data and file manipulation. These skills will be extremely useful in my career. I want to combine business with the technological skills I have learned to enhance my overall human capital. Also knowing Visual Studio Code, along with commands makes coding much faster. I can take Git over into my career path going forward to make project collaborations more effective.

###### Future Employer

How I would go about explaining to a future employer on how this class experience gave me additional skills would be the following. I learned Linux systems along with terminal commands that allow me to efficiently and effectively store, pull and push data. I also learned Linux Bash scripting. Using an editor like Vim allows me to write bash scripts that can run tedious maintenance jobs or even fix symlinks. Downloading Python libraries and other helpful programs makes Linux convenient. 

Furthermore, I learned more advanced applications using Visual Studio Code. Including, debugging, stepping into my code, using Git as a version control software, and learning keyboard shortcuts to be more time sensitive. 

Lastly, I learned Git in this class, which should be useful in group projects. No one will step on each other's toes, if everyone in a team can create their own branch of the main source, and add their work in the branch and then merge it back in. This class has taught me to be more comfortable with various software applications. Including other versions of Linux on Windows or using VMware. As well as setting up and connecting my Linux to GitHub and other IDE's and using different terminals in Linux like Bash and Zsh.
