## My CSC-490 Class Reflection

Going into CSC-490, I was not sure what to expect as I am somewhat new to computer science in general. I only recently decided to change my major from psychology to computer science/business so initially, I was a bit nervous about how I would perform in this class with it being only my third ever CS course. However, I quickly came to really enjoy my experience in in this class and feel the knowledge I have acquired from it will be very useful for me in the future.

In the first week of CSC-490, we were taught the basics of using the bash shell and how it can be much more interactive and efficient for creating and managing files on a computer. After seeing all the various aspects and advantages of using a shell to manage my device, instead of the cpu's normal file explorer, I was very excited to learn more. Within the first couple days, I quickly began to see how the material in this class would be very useful for real world applications. 

The second week of this class explored VS Code which is a code editor that, when utilizes correctly, employs many features to maximize simplicity and efficiency for the user when writing code. I appreciated this section of the class very much as it showed how using VS Code can substantially improve the ease of programming, nomatter what language you are writing in. I particularly enjoyed exploring the various extensions available for VS Code and their practical implementations for improving the users overall experience when programming. After this, in the third and final week of this class, we learned about git, a software that allows users to effectively monitor and collaborate on a project. I fealt this section of the class dealing with git really brought awareness to me about how the skills I have acquired in my computer science courses would look when applied to a real world work environment. 

Going into this semester, my previous two computer science classes dealt strictly with the programming language of Python and I found it very intriguing to see how the knowledge I gained from those classes would be improved upon by the material taught in this course. I can now manage my Python scripts within a shell or make use of the advantages to writing Python in VS Code opposed the less efficient code editors I had used in the past.

My experiences from this class have made me feel a lot better about computer science classes I will take in the future. This course has
