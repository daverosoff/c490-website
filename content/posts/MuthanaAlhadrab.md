This page explains my experience in the Applied Software Engineering class. A winter term class that complimented my Computer Science experience in the College of Idaho. This course advances one’s knowledge about Linux systems, and optimizes the one’s programming experience. 

## The problem
After finishing most of my CS course, there were some missing puzzle pieces. For example, I learned Python and C++, yet I had little to no knowledge about the Command Line or it's usage to compile code or anything else. Moreover, in previous programming courses, Cocalc was the main platform to write code. It didn't have a strong UI customization and wasn't optimal for professional programming. Lastly, after writing our codes and projects in other classes. I needed be familiarized with on how to share and upload our work on the net and extend it to working on open-source projects. 

These main problems were entirely addressed in this class. I got familiar with the Terminal (Command Line) and Linux Systems, and how to capitalize on it's tools. Moreover, I got introduced to Visual Studio Code, where I was able to customize my coding experience to make coding more efficient. And lastly, I learned about Git as an intermediary platform to keep track of my files and workflows, share it online, or even work with other people on it.

## What I learned
In this class, I got introduced to three main topics:

# Command Line
In this Section, I learned about all about the Command Line
## SHELLS
In this secction, I learned about zsh, bash, and other shell scripts. I leaned their properties, how to switch between them and how to customize them for my own use.
## Vim, Vi, wildcards
In this section I learned about the editor, utilizing wildcards, create and modify shell scripts using Vim.
## Pipelining and redirections
In this section, I learned about the
## Bash scripting
In this section, I learned how to script in bash and and create executable files based on the assignmnet given. 
## (Specific) topics
1. Navigation around the computer
2. Retrieving information about files and directories
3. File creation and manipulation
5. Permissions
6. Filters
7. Grep and regular expressions
8. Pipelining and redirections
9. Symlinks operations

# Visual Studio Code
As Cocalc couldn't serve as an extensive professional programming platform, the class provided the opportunity to learn about Visual Studio Code and its functionalities. I started by learning all the keyboard shortcuts, which helped me cut the time in writing code by half. The ability to make multiple changes in a file simultaneously is a game changer for writing code fast. 
Moreover, I learned about the inner functionalities of VS, how to bug and debug code, extensions, snippets, etc. This section has addressed most of the essential areas in coding in Visual Studio Code, and made it my default Coding platform.

# Git
In this section, I learned about Git, Github, and other Git tools. I believe Git is one of the best intermediary platforms to share your own code and work with others on projects. 
Some of the main topics I learned in class are: 
1. Git basics: repository creation and manipulation, commits, remotes, tagging, aliasing, etc.
2. Git branching: branches, merging, workflows, rebasing, etc.
3. Git on the server: protocols, SSH keys, GitWeb, GitLab, smart HTTPs, etc.
4. Distributed Git: distributed workflows, contributing to a project, etc.
6. Git with Visual Studio Code: performing Git operations from Visual Studio Code

## Learning outcomes:
1. Recognize and describe fundamental ideas from course content.
2. Illustrate these ideas with examples and translate them into everyday terminology.
3. Demonstrate the use of course ideas on specific computing problems.
4. Improvement in programming skills.
5. Effectively discuss and solve computing problems in group settings.
6. Apply a range of algorithmic techniques appropriately.
7. Plan, organize, and combine algorithms or arguments to solve new problems, as appropriate.

## Class structure and final thoughts
Moving from the class outcomes and layout, it was structured in a way to emphasize learning. The class was usually divided into theory part, where we would discuss our readings, and an application part, where we would apply what we learned in a team-based environment to finish the given tasks. I believe that this structure was optimal for learning. In general, this was one of the most useful classes that I took. It provided all of the missing puzzle pieces for the software engineering experience.
