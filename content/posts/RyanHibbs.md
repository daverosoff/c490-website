# Where I started
#### Previous Experience
Coming into this class I felt like I had a decent understanding of the idea of version control and how the command line worked from having worked an internship this summer for a company called Panaton in Boise. I gained a relative understanding of how git worked, but it pales in comparison to how I feel about my understanding now. To quote a conversation we had during the term, you mentioned that a lot of people view git and its commands as a sort of magic tool that just does what they need but have no understanding of what or how it does it. Prior to taking this class I fell into that same category. I learned about the idea of version control and pull requests through bitbuckets UI and had a page in my notebook that I referred to to remember the process of pushing committing etc.

I knew what github was and have implemented things from other people into my own projects in the past, but had never actually joined the site. And I had used VS code as well as two other IDE's put out by JetBrains called pyCharm and Webstorm for my code.

When I started programming in highschool I started with java, and then here at C of I I took C++ classes. This summer I worked primarily in TypeScript and for this class I wrote my scripts in Python. I had never written a Bash script before taking this class.

Having had some experience with Typescript I had interacted with some HTML as well as JSON files prior to CS 490.

#### What I enjoyed learning about

# Outside of this class
Make note of how I just wrote something to filter the responses to major minor form for PEAK mentor Job. 
# Summary
Really glad took the class. Was originally in different class not applicable to major. No offense to learning about finite languages and automata as I understand how they are very important and can be very useful Im glad I learned about them. But this is the type of thing I enjoy learning about. How to actually like make a project with a team and work towards building something cool.
GIT
Sparked my interest up again, I have found myself doing advent of code problems in free time and out of habit needed to just write down a list of names for a playoff fantasy football draft that I created in VIM
